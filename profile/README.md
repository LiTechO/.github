# LiTechO

We are a team that makes many random stuff, ranging from Discord 🤖 and ending up with (maybe) cool 🎮.

## Contact

If you have any 💡, or maybe want to become a part of our 👥, feel free to 📞 us at litecho@inbox.ru or through the Discord:

- LimeGeeg#0307 ([@LimeGeeg](https://github.com/LimeGeeg)) | The team's founder, coordinator and magnanimous dictator
- nakamita#9597 ([@weerdy15](https://github.com/weerdy15)) | Team's engineer
- Debug_pro#5355 (Unknown GitHub) | Rare guest. Sometimes he does nothing, sometimes he helps very much, sometimes he does something that we're cannot understand. Strange man

## Press F
